Charles Robert Darwin FRS FRGS FLS FZS JP (12 February 1809 â€“ 19 April 1882)
was an English naturalist, geologist, and biologist, widely known for his
contributions to evolutionary biology. His proposition that all species of
life have descended from a common ancestor is now generally accepted and
considered a fundamental concept in science.

Darwin published his theory of evolution with compelling evidence in his 1859
book On the Origin of Species. By the 1870s, the scientific community and a
majority of the educated public had accepted evolution as a fact. However,
many favoured competing explanations that gave only a minor role to natural
selection, and it was not until the emergence of the modern evolutionary
synthesis from the 1930s to the 1950s that a broad consensus developed in
which natural selection was the basic mechanism of evolution. Darwin's
scientific discovery is the unifying theory of the life sciences, explaining
the diversity of life.
